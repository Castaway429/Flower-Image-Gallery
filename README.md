# Flower-Image-Gallery
An image gallery where you can scroll forward or backward in this folder of flower pictures


I created this code with a file of images and just coded it to cycle through these in the order that they were in the folder via the forward and backward buttons. If it doesn't do that for any other person then you might need to tweak and fix it to be able to do that for you.


The simple tweak is to just put the individual photos back into a folder and edit the code to the name of the folder.
